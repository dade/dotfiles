# My dotfiles
For the time being this houses only neovim, since that's the main one I use (and can put online without dropping sensitive info!)

The setup is simple. I went through the most common setups from nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim and then separated them so that I could customize each module easily, separate their installations, and set up keymaps that I liked for those specific plugins.

Most of this is fairly standard, nothing crazy. It's all similar to most other configs. I use `mini.nvim` a lot, since those packages are really, really good IMO!
